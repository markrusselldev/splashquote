# SplashQuote
Get a random quote from Quotable.io -> Search Unsplash.com using each quote's tags.

**Demo: [SplashQuote](https://markrusselldev.github.io/splashquote/)**


## Goals
1. Build a random quote machine using front end development libraries and/or JavaScript and without React.
2. Use jQuery and Bootstrap as much as possible and keep the CSS and JavaScript to a bare minimum.
3. Send both the quote and the image to social media via buttons

## ToDo
- Goal 3: Need something like [Prerender](https://prerender.io)to inject meta tags before the DOM is rendered for the social bots.

## Notes
- Image size is set to 1920x1080 by default. This can be changed in main.js
- Workaround for Goal 3 above: Added copy image url button
